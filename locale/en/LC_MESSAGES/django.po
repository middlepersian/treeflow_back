"Resulting from its status as the official language of the Sasanian Empire "
"(3rd–7th centuries CE), the Middle Persian language played a prominent "
"transcultural role during a period stretching from late antiquity to the "
"early Islamic period. Besides serving as a medium of communication between "
"the linguistically and culturally diverse areas of Western and Eastern Iran, "
"it was employed as a literary language by several religious traditions."

"The Middle Persian corpus consists of Zoroastrian, Manichaean, narrative, "
"administrative and epigraphic sub-corpora. The Zoroastrian Middle Persian "
"corpus represents by far the largest among these and has so far only "
"partially been examined. Our project therefore aims at the creation of a "
"digital corpus of Zoroastrian Middle Persian texts in Pahlavi script (in "

"dictionary covering that corpus."
