"Resulting from its status as the official language of the Sasanian Empire "
"(3rd–7th centuries CE), the Middle Persian language played a prominent "
"transcultural role during a period stretching from late antiquity to the "
"early Islamic period. Besides serving as a medium of communication between "
"the linguistically and culturally diverse areas of Western and Eastern Iran, "
"it was employed as a literary language by several religious traditions."
msgstr ""

#: treeflow/templates/base.html:75
msgid ""
"The Middle Persian corpus consists of Zoroastrian, Manichaean, narrative, "
"administrative and epigraphic sub-corpora. The Zoroastrian Middle Persian "
"corpus represents by far the largest among these and has so far only "
"partially been examined. Our project therefore aims at the creation of a "
"digital corpus of Zoroastrian Middle Persian texts in Pahlavi script (in "
"short: Pahlavi texts) as well as at the development of a comprehensive "
"dictionary covering that corpus."
msgstr ""

#: treeflow/templates/base.html:79
msgid ""
"The corpus consists of roughly 50 texts, containing some 705,000 tokens. As "
"its point of departure, the project relies on the ca. 20 oldest Pahlavi "
"codices (from the 13th–17th centuries CE). The texts contained in those "
"codices will be supplied with several layers of annotation:"

"Within the overall structure of the project, the corpus and dictionary "
"function as closely interrelated analytical tools even though their focal "
"points differ (syntax vs. semantics). Their technical integration also plays "
"an essential role in the general <a class=\"text-sm lg:text-sm md:text-xs sm:"
"text-xs text-off hover:text-action\" href=\"/methodology\">workflow</a> of "
"the project. For this purpose, the project employs a web-based working "
"environment that facilitates the collaborative work on the corpus and "
"dictionary. The same environment will also provide a public user interface "
"for enquiries into those resources that have already been processed at a "
"given point in time."

"The project intends to create a platform that may in the future also be used "
"for the remaining Middle Persian sub-corpora, as well as for the corpora of "

"all of its sub-corpora) as well as to an expansion of the corpus into the "
"domains of other Middle Iranian languages."
